# Tutorial class
 Here are some notes for the tutorial class. I'm lazy to type them or rewrite some of them, so I will upload some photos for temporary replacement.



For convenience, I put links here:

###Session 1

We have a tough work this week. The topics are as follows:


- linear space (preliminary)
- Inner product, norm (Task 1.1, 2, Ex' 4(a)), metric (Task 1.2, Ex 2, Ex' 3) and topology (Ex 1, Ex' 2, 4(b)). 

The lecture note [Functional Analysis](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~wangzuoq/Courses/15F-FA/index.html) is highly recommended. That may be hard for students in physical institude.

- Computations of partial derivatives (Ex 3), Taylor expansion (Task 3(a,d))


- Minimum and maximum  (Task 3(b,c), Ex 4, Ex' 1)

- $\varepsilon-\delta$ language, convergence (Task 4).

[Limits, L'HÃ´pital's rule, and epsilon delta definitions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfF40MiS7zA): see 4:52-9:53

###Session 2

We discuss about the topology in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The subsets in $\mathbb{C}$ is also discussed.

###Session 4

We talk about some preliminaries: sets, pictures and equivalent descriptions. Finally we review the topological concepts for those exercises.

###Session 5

This week we discuss about topological spaces and their properties. For a more detailed discussion about this topic, please see Prof. Zuoqin Wang's [lecture notes](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~wangzuoq/Courses/19S-Topology/index.html).

###Session 6

This week we do exercises.
