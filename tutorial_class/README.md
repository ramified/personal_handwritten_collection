# Tutorial class
 Here are some notes for the tutorial class. I'm lazy to type them or rewrite some of them, so I will upload some photos for temporary replacement.



For convenience, I put links here:

[Dimensions - A walk through mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUn7jJ0E8tE&list=PL97CCC2CC4E89C7E5&index=5): I really like this video. Maybe we can see some of Part 5, 6 and 9 this time.

[The 5 ways to visualize complex functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtoIXhUgqSk): The visualization of complex functions is always an interesting topic.

[Why care about complex analysis?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoTaJE16uLk&list=PLDcSwjT2BF_UDdkQ3KQjX5SRQ2DLLwv0R&index=1) We can see in class from 0:00 to 1:40. This explains the motivations for physical students to learn the complex analysis.

[exponential function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0YEaeIClKY) and [Euler's Formula Poem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLzLxVeqdQg): The work of 3Blue1Brown is usually nice.
