# Tutorial class
 Here are some notes for the tutorial class. I'm lazy to type them or rewrite some of them, so I will upload some photos for temporary replacement.



For convenience, I put links here:

###Session 1

[Dimensions - A walk through mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUn7jJ0E8tE&list=PL97CCC2CC4E89C7E5&index=5): I really like this video. Maybe we can see some of Part 5, 6 and 9 this time.

[The 5 ways to visualize complex functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtoIXhUgqSk): The visualization of complex functions is always an interesting topic.

[Why care about complex analysis?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoTaJE16uLk&list=PLDcSwjT2BF_UDdkQ3KQjX5SRQ2DLLwv0R&index=1) We can see in class from 0:00 to 1:40. This explains the motivations for physical students to learn the complex analysis.

[exponential function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0YEaeIClKY) and [Euler's Formula Poem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLzLxVeqdQg): The work of 3Blue1Brown is usually nice.

#####Fourier analysis

[But what is the Fourier Transform? A visual introduction.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY)
[But what is a Fourier series? From heat flow to drawing with circles | DE4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k)
[What is a Fourier Series? (Explained by drawing circles)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds0cmAV-Yek) and [Animation](https://bilimneguzellan.net/fuyye-serisi/)
[The intuition behind Fourier and Laplace transforms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gjJDuCAEQQ)
<!--[What does the Laplace Transform really tell us? A visual explanation (plus applications)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2y7n6jw5d0) see 2:06-2:23-->
