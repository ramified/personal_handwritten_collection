This is the notes of six functor formalism. They are written for the online seminar (as well as for my own research). Compare with Prof. Scholze's notes, this series of notes have the following feature:

1. easy and naive.
2. mainly focus on the examples rather than the general formalism.
3. try to explain the well-known phenomenons, rather than create new theory.
