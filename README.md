 Here are some documents which are not written by LaTeX, and there are often some screenshots from the references. Those notes are only for the educational purpose.



I mean, the documents in the folder named "sketsch_of_lectures" are not useful for you. I keep them here only for the convenience of myself.

####Explanations about the missed date of "Eine Woche,  ein Beispiel"(in Chinese, "日拱一卒")

November 28th-December 5th, 2021: focus on the "moduli".

December 19th, 2021: focus on the "moduli of vector bundles"

January 2nd, 2022: focus on the "moduli of elliptic curves"(haven't finished actually)

January 23rd, 2022: I saw the videos of the mini-course “$p$-adic functions on $\mathbb{Z}_p$” by Liang Xiao (Peking University), you can get it (videos, lecture notes and even exersices) here: https://ctnt-summer.math.uconn.edu/schedules-and-abstracts-2020-online/. Roughly speaking, we begin doing basic analysis on the $p$-adic world. Here are some highlights:

- Down-to-earth examples as well as beautiful picture of $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
- Understand the $p$-adic function space $\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{Z}_p;\mathbb{Q}_p)$: define Mahler basis(compare with Fourier analysis) and $p$-adic measure $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{Z}_p;\mathbb{Q}_p)$.
- Define $p$-adic $L$-function and construct corresponding $p$-adic measures on Galois groups; As an application, prove Kummer's congruence whose statement is elementary. 
- Philosophy: every $L$-function should have some $p$-adic version of $L$-function as well as corresponding measures.


February 6th, 2022: prepare for the exam.
