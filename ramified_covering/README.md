This folder contains notes introducing my interests to Yilong Zhang. The series originated from Galois theory, but I soon realized it could serve as a perfect starting point to spark interest in various seemingly unrelated topics. After further exploring the analogy between (ramified) coverings and (function) field extensions, I gradually discovered the beauty and unity in mathematics.

We cite mainly Lec 2: Spaces of valuations. The other part also worth reading, if you have problem reading the berkeley notes.
