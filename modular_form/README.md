This is the "notes" of modular forms which are only useful for giving a talk. They are badly written(I bet! They even contain Chinese :-) and is only beneficial for me and people who listens me explaining them.



Some references for interested readers and for labeling:

Most of them can be easily found on the internet.



I wrote something and will make screenshots without mentioning it: (Also, most of them are Chinese)
