This is the notes of Langlands program. They are written for the final exam of the course " [The arithmetic of the Langlands program](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~acaraian/alp.pdf)". I don't guarentee anything to be correct or complete, but any typo or suggestion is  highly welcomed.



Some references for interested readers and for labeling:

Most of them can be easily found on the internet.
